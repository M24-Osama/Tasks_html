        Computer programming or coding is the composition of sequences of
        instructions, called programs, that computers can follow to perform
        tasks.</mark
      >[1][2] It involves designing and implementing algorithms, step-by-step
      specifications of procedures, by writing code in one or more programming
      languages. Programmers typically use high-level programming languages that
      are more easily intelligible to humans than machine code, which is
      directly executed by the central processing unit. Proficient programming
      usually requires expertise in several different subjects, including
      knowledge of the application domain, details
      <u
        >of programming languages and generic code libraries, specialized
        algorithms, and formal logic.</u

      In the 1880s, Herman Hollerith invented the concept of storing data in
      machine-readable form.[11] Later a control panel (plug board) added to his
      1906 Type I Tabulator allowed it to be programmed for different jobs, and
      by the late 1940s, unit record equipment such as the IBM 602 and IBM 604,
      were programmed by control panels in a similar way, as were the first
      electronic computers. However,<mark
        >with the concept of the stored-program computer introduced in
        1949,</mark
      >
      both programs and data were stored and manipulated in the same way in
      computer memory.[12]

      Auxiliary tasks accompanying and related to programming include analyzing
      requirements, testing, debugging (investigating and fixing problems),
      implementation of build systems, and management of derived artifacts, such
      as programs' machine code. While these are sometimes considered
      programming, often the term software development is used for this larger
      overall process â€“ with the terms programming, implementation, and coding
      reserved for the writing and editing of code per se. Sometimes software
      development is known as software engineering, especially when it employs
      formal methods or follows an engineering design process.

      Programming is the process of creating instructions that a computer can
      follow to perform specific tasks. It involves writing code in languages
      like Python, Java, C++, and JavaScript, among others. Programmers use
      these languages to develop software, build websites, create games, and
      automate tasks. The process of programming includes designing algorithms,
      debugging, and testing to ensure the code runs smoothly and efficiently.
      Programming is not just about writing code; it's about problem-solving and
      logical thinking. It requires understanding the problem at hand, breaking
      it down into smaller, manageable parts, and then constructing a solution
      through code. Learning programming can be challenging, but it is also
      highly rewarding as it opens up numerous opportunities in various
      industries such as technology, finance, healthcare, and more. As
      technology continues to evolve, programming skills become increasingly
      valuable in today's digital world.
