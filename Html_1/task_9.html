    <h1>Linear Equations</h1>
    <p>
      An equation that has a maximum degree of one is known as a linear
      equation. The graph of it is a straight line.
    </p>
    <p>For example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>y = 8x - 2</li>
      <li>ax<sub>1</sub> + bx<sub>2</sub> - cx<sub>3</sub> = 9</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These are some examples of linear equations in two and three variables.

    <p>
      y<sub>1</sub> = mx<sub>1</sub> + a and <br />
      y<sub>2</sub> = mx<sub>2</sub> + b
    </p>
    <p>
      For the points P(x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>) and Q(x<sub>2</sub>,
      y<sub>2</sub>) is:
    </p>
    <p>m = (y<sub>2</sub> - y<sub>1</sub>) / (x<sub>2</sub> - x<sub>1</sub>)</p>
